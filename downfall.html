    <h1>The Downfall of Oedipus</h1>

    <h3>The Plague of Thebes</h3>
    <p>
        Years after Oedipus became the king of Thebes, the city was ravaged by a plague. The people of Thebes looked to their king, Oedipus, for answers. Determined to save his kingdom, Oedipus sent his brother-in-law Creon to consult the Oracle of Delphi once again. The Oracle revealed that the plague was a result of the unpunished murder of the former king, Laius.

    <h3>Oedipus' Quest for the Truth</h3>
    <p>
        Oedipus vowed to rid Thebes of the curse by finding the murderer of Laius. 
        He did not know, however, that he was searching for himself. Oedipus interrogated witnesses, 
        consulted prophets, and called for anyone with information to come forward. All the while, 
        his true identity began to unravel.
    </p>

    <h3>The Revelations</h3>
    <p>
        Piece by piece, the horrific truth was revealed: Oedipus was the very man he was searching for. 
        The stranger he had killed years ago on the road to Thebes was none other than his father, Laius. 
        The woman he had married and fathered children with was his mother, Jocasta. The prophecy he had 
        tried so hard to avoid had come true, sealing his fate.

    <h3>Jocasta's Despair and Oedipus' Punishment</h3>
    <p>
        Upon realizing the truth, Jocasta, overwhelmed with grief and horror, took her own life. Oedipus, 
        stricken with guilt and shame, blinded himself as punishment for his sins. Unable to bear the sight 
        of the world he had destroyed, Oedipus chose exile from Thebes, wandering blind and broken, accompanied only by his daughters.
    </p>

    <h3>The Legacy of Oedipus</h3>
    <p>
        Oedipus' story stands as a testament to the inescapable nature of fate and the consequences of human pride. 
        His tragic downfall teaches us that no man, no matter how powerful, can escape the will of the gods. Oedipus 
        sought to defy his destiny, but in the end, his own actions fulfilled it.
