    <h1>The Prophecy</h1>

    <h3>Prophecy Origin</h3>
    <p>Before the birth of Oedipus, King Laius, ruler of Thebes, sought the Oracle of Delphi to understand his fate. 
        The Oracle warned him that <b>his own son would one day kill him, marry his own mother, and bring ruin to his kingdom</b>. Terrified of this future, 
        King Laius made the fateful decision to abandon his newborn son to avoid the prophecy from coming true. </p>

    <h3>The Oracle of Delphi</h3>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>One of the most revered and powerful figures in ancient Greece. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/video/180008/oracle-Delphi">The Oracle</a> was believed to communicate directly with the god Apollo, offering prophecies that shaped fates.</li>
        <li>When Laius received his prophecy, he knew that attempting to escape it would be futile, yet still took drastic measures to avoid it.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>The Abandonment of Oedipus</h3>
    <p>To prevent the prophecy, Laius and Jocasta ordered their infant son to be left to die on Mount Cithaeron. However, fate intervened 
        when a shepherd found the child and took him to the royal family of Corinth.
    </p>

    <h3>The Inevitable Fate</h3>
    <p>Though Oedipus was raised far from Thebes, the shadow of the prophecy loomed over him. His eventual quest to 
        avoid his fate would tragically lead him right back to the very destiny he sought to escape.
